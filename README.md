# Express Fruits App RTT-2025-04 (in class)

This application, built in Node with Express is a full CRUD API. 
We have 4 custom routes:
GET /fruits - get ALL fruits in the db
GET /fruits/:id - get ONE fruit (by id)
PUT /fruits/:id - edits a fruit (by id)
POST /fruits - create a new fruit
DELETE /fruits/:id - deletes a fruit (by id)

You can find the frontend from class [here](https://github.com/tishana/react-fruits-2025-04).
